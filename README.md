Introduction:

With the increasing reliance on digital transactions, credit card fraud has become a major concern for individuals and financial institutions. Fraudulent activities can cause significant financial losses, erode consumer trust, and harm the reputation of companies. Our goal in this project is to detect these fraudulent transactions by analyzing patterns in the dataset and predicting potential fraud using advanced machine learning techniques.

Data Source:

The dataset used in this project is provided by Machine Learning Group - ULB and is publicly available on Kaggle  https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud. It contains 284,807 transactions made by European credit cardholders over two days in September 2013. Out of these, only 492 transactions (0.172%) are fraudulent, which presents a significant challenge due to the severe class imbalance.

Objective:

The primary objective of this project is to build a fraud detection system that can:

Accurately distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions.
Identify the patterns and characteristics associated with fraud, such as transaction amount, time of transaction, or specific trends across time periods.
Minimize false positives (incorrectly flagged as fraud) and false negatives (missed fraud cases).
By leveraging machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), we aim to detect fraud in real-time, allowing financial institutions to protect their customers and reduce losses from cyberattacks.

Challenges and Importance:

Credit card fraud detection poses several challenges, including:

Severe class imbalance: With less than 0.2% of the dataset labeled as fraud, itâ€™s crucial to develop models that are highly sensitive to minority classes while avoiding bias toward the majority class.

Dynamic behavior of fraudsters: Fraudulent activities evolve over time, making it essential to continually improve and update detection systems to stay ahead of cybercriminals.
Real-time detection: In real-world scenarios, fraud detection systems need to operate in real-time to identify and prevent fraudulent transactions before they are completed.
Methodology

Data Preprocessing:

We will clean the data, handle missing values, and perform feature engineering to extract meaningful insights.
The dataset's features are anonymized using PCA (Principal Component Analysis), except for Time, Amount, and the target variable Class, which will require careful handling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Through data visualization techniques, we will explore the distribution of transaction amounts, the occurrence of fraud over time, and other key insights.
Patterns such as time of day and transaction amounts associated with fraudulent activities will be analyzed to identify trends.

Model Building:

We will experiment with multiple machine learning algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, to build a robust fraud detection model.
Model evaluation will be performed using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score. Due to class imbalance, recall (sensitivity) will be a critical metric to ensure that fraudulent transactions are not missed.

Deployment:

Once the model is optimized, it can be deployed to operate in real-time to flag suspicious transactions, thus protecting users from fraudulent activity.
